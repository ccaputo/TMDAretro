Tagged Message Delivery Agent (TMDA) for Python 2.7

TMDA is an open source software application designed to significantly reduce the amount of spam (Internet junk-mail) you receive.

TMDAretro was created for those who rely on TMDA and need it to continue working with Python 2.7. It was forked from Kevin Goodsell's [tmda-fork](https://github.com/KevinGoodsell/tmda-fork).

The tmda-cgi subdirectory is not maintained.
